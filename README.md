# NucPos_Clustering
## Clustering Analysis of Nucleosome Positioning Data
Description: Micrococcal nuclease digestion with deep sequencing (MNase-seq) is a molecular biology technique that measures nucleosome occupancy across the whole genome. After processing paired-end MNase-seq data using the workflow here: https://github.com/etc27/MNaseseq-workflow/blob/main/README.md, a table is generated that contains nucleosome profiles across different genomic regions. The following code loads metadata from the generation of nucleosome TSS metaprofiles (profiles showing average nucleosome occupancy relative to the Transcription Start Site of genes) and performs dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis in order to learn meaningful patterns in the data. In combination with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, information about global gene expression is also included in the models to provide more information about gene features for cluster assignment.
